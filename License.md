# All Arma 3 files (Except those that link to my [Strict Licence](https://github.com/Eagle-Studios/CE_Mods/blob/main/LicenseStrict.md)) are licensed under the [APL-SA licence](https://www.bohemia.net/community/licenses/arma-public-license-share-alike)

## In short, this means:  

With this licence you are free to adapt (i.e. modify, rework or update) and share (i.e. copy, distribute or transmit) the material under the following conditions:

   - Attribution - You must attribute the material in the manner specified by the author or licensor (but not in any way that suggests that they endorse you or your use of the material).
   - Noncommercial - You may not use this material for any commercial purposes.
   - Arma Only - You may not convert or adapt this material to be used in other games than Arma 3. 
   - Share Alike - If you adapt, or build upon this material, you may distribute the resulting material only under the same license.

## Furthermore: 

- You **MUST** attribute myself (The Creator/Source) on any/all modifications which inherit some or wholey the content that I have created.
   - This applies to both this GitHub **AND** my Steam Workshop. 

- You **MUST** retain any/all supplied licenses and supporting documents. 

- You **MUST** provide a link to the original source as part of any description(s).
   - _Original source being this repository OR the Steam Workshop page_.

- You **MUST** acknowledge that I reserve the right to deny the use of any of my creations at any time.
   - _This includes the revoking of past permissions, should I feel the need to do so_.
     
- You **MUST NOT** open or modify the provided PBO files in my mod(s). (You can freely modify, via class inheritance contained within your own mod(s)).

- You **CANNOT** reupload my PBO files (You **MUST** add my mod(s) as a requiredAddon only), following the other terms of this licence. 

## Additionally

### Any mods published via this repository OR my Steam Workshop page **ARE NOT** to be used by any of the following;

   - Life or other Servers where my mod files are intended to be used behind a pay/donation wall - Life or other Servers can **ONLY** use my files where they are available for everyone to use (Having them behind a role I.E Coast Guard, is fine, providing you are not asking for money in order to be that role). 

   - Any servers that are used to depict current world conflicts (aka the Current Wars in: Ukraine & Gaza)


## Finally:

### Units listed here in this section have an outright refusal to use of any of my mods uploaded here **OR** on my steam workshop page **OR** any files that I have previously allowed you to use. 
_This ban is in place as usually you have violated my trust by removing or changing mod/license files to remove any mention of myself AND make it appear like you own the mods, therefore I have no choice except to outright refuse you to use them._

---------------
**The Canadian Tactical Group aka CTG:**

   - This includes members of this group uploading their own modifications, regardless of their intentions to not use it for this unit.
   - This also refuses this group, or any of its members from using ANY other files that I personally created and allowed you to use.

---------------
**Any Unit that use some or part of some illegal mods (Like TFL/Taxer/Hyun/etc/etc)**
   - You know exactly  what mods I am referring to.. ANY mod that has been ripped is included as part of this.
