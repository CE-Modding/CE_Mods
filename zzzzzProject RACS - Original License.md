Concept:	Originally designed to make the RACS not suck so bad. The theory is as a former spanish colony
		that was also a port for the Royal Navy at some point. The Royal Sahrani Army, Royal Sahrani Airforce, 
		and Royal Sahrani Navy, will be supprted by NATO equipment. Therefore we decided to get permissions 
		for some community made Add-ons and reskin them for the RACS. We also decided to make some modified 
		projects of our own such as missile boats, different helicopter variants, and anything else we were crazy 
		enough to mess with. Some of these addons are ports from Vilas, RHS, UNSUNG, VTE, Falklands MOD, FFAA, 
		FDF, Bushwars, VME, and other MODS. A3 models and mod based on RHS. Please see individual sections for Credits.

Arma1:		Project RACS was an attempt at fleshing out the RACS faction into a complete military. Equipment and missions 
		addressed the Sahrani Army's ability to fight independently of US forces while pooling the equipment to do so 
		from the western world and some eastern influences.  

Arma2:		Project RACS evolved into the most complete, Independent, faction one could have for Arma2 and Operation Arrowhead. 
		We presented as the Sahrani nation shedding the the civil war and modernizing itself into a NATO standardized partner.

Arma3:		This iteration of the mod will be much more of the same with Sahrani still independent yet closely aligned with NATO and
		the United States. Equipment will continue to evolve and modernize.
