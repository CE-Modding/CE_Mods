### Description: 
This is a proper intergration of the recent Quick Smoke mod, which had config errors.
This does not have this issue as it is properly intergrated.

Apparently I need to spell this out in simple terms.

Smoke and Destruction effects will now only last 2-3 minutes. THAT'S IT. That's the only change (So far)

Feel free to suggest other ways in which performance could be increased.
Current suggestions, that will be looked into:
- Splendid Smoke Rework compat.
- Thick black smoke on Vehicle destruction: reduce or replace.
- Drones having overkill smoke and no explosion sfx?
    
### If you have an issue with this mod (and my other mods having a dependency onto CE - MAIN)
There is no obligation for you to download this mod, so dont like the new change I have made adding in a dependency to my new mod that assist with my licence? - Dont download it, simple as.

I have every right to do what I want with this mod, regardless of what your or anything else thinks. I have chosen to take steps to further protect myself and my mods from people who decide that stealing and claiming work as their own is okay, it is not.
