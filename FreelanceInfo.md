# Freelance (What I offer, How much I charge, How I work, Disclaimer & License)
## Disclaimer & License 

**Any work I do as a freelancer (I.e adhoc/one-off/short term) is subject to the following:**
- Any and All work will have my [Freelance License](LicenseFreelance) applied in order to protect myself.
   - The only way this stipulation can be altered is by buying the appropriate 'upgrade' (See [How Much I Charge](LINK))
   - Work completed under freelance, shall be provided with a licence document stating that you can reupload that specific work, thus waiving the APL-NDs reupload policy
      - Ensure this document is kept with the PBO. 

- Any and All work which is proposed **MUST** follow Bohemia's EULA. 
   - From Their Own Discord: 
      - You CANNOT pay someone to do ANYTHING involving Bohemia Interactive Tools (Arma Tools, Workbench, etc) at any stage - you can pay for 3D models, textures etc but not for game integration.
      - You (or someone different from and unrelated to the person you paid for said resources) will have to assemble and encode them yourself

Selling Arma-ready assets (p3d, bin, paa, etc...) is illegal (and the buyer can be scammed with no legal backup).

- Acknowledge that the work I do, shall not be used in mods which are considered grey areas. 
   - If you need to question if your mod is considered to be in a grey area, i.e not strictly following the EULA, then my work is not to be used for it. 

- Acknowledge I accept no responsibility for mods that receive DMCA's and/or Removal from the Steam Workshop.
   - Any work I complete shall be done so, following the licenses of other creaters involved (Either directly or indirectly). 
      - I.e. If you need a compat mod for RHS then I shall follow RHS's license, should the mod you make (which includes my files) recieve a DMCA from RHS (In this examples case), I shall not be held responsible (in-part or wholey) for the infractions caused, **UNLESS** the infractions are **DIRECTLY** to-do with my files. 

## How I work

As a freelancer, I work how and when I want to, the only time I work to a deadline is when you are paying me to do so. <br>

I have the right to live a life outside of any work I undertake. <br>

I work on a per hour rate (see [How Much I Charge](LINK)), which is worked out only on the time spent completing the work required, I do this to ensure that you (the purchaser) are not in a position to tell me when I can or cannot be working. <br>

I can provide an itemised breakdown of the price I quote, should you wish. <br>

I may not be able to complete all the work you have asked, should this be the case I shall discuss with you the options I can offer (I.e. The retexturing that you have ordered requires extra work that is beyond my ability, I shall discuss options like paying someone I know to complete that part of the work as part of the payment plan you have with me (or perhaps you wish to go elsewhere to your own person for that) either way, this (or the matter in  hand) shall be discussed BEFORE I commit to doing anything further). <br>

I work under the idea that by providing an affordable & transparent service, that you may come back to me with further work, or perhaps direct someone else my way. <br>

I am able and more than willing to provide updates to any work that you have tasked me to complete, I do this in order to give peace of mind that I am actually working on your work. <br>

I may be able to offer milestone based payments which turn any work into modules which you can pay for separately. <br>

## How Much I Charge
For general config work I work at a rate of £40 per-hour, _as mentioned above_ this is calculated on how much time I have spent working specifically on your project or if paying using the _described above_ milestone system, it will be worked as per the agreed module. <br>

Should you wish to edit, modify, build upon the work provided, I charge an additional £80 to waive the [supplied license](LicenseFreelance). <br>

Note that additional charges may occur should I need to spend time looking into/researching a topic that your project involves; this will be communicated with you at the time. <br>

Scripting, 3D moddelling are servies that I cannot provide personally (I do have contacts that can do these).
