# Freelance (What I offer, How much I charge, How I work, Disclaimer & License)
## Disclaimer & License 

**Any work I do as a freelancer (I.e adhoc/one-off/short term) is subject to the following:**
- Any and All work will have my [Freelance License](LicenseFreelance.md) applied in order to protect myself.
   - The only way this stipulation can be altered is by buying the license waiver (See [How Much I Charge](https://github.com/Eagle-Studios/CE_Mods/blob/main/FreelanceInfo.md#how-much-i-charge))

- I can and Will obfuscate any work where possible. 
   - The only way this stipulation can be altered is by buying the license waiver (See [How Much I Charge](https://github.com/Eagle-Studios/CE_Mods/blob/main/FreelanceInfo.md#how-much-i-charge))
   - I may be able to provide a non-obfucated file (where possible), in order to allow you to do your own work using my work as basis (Think like a template)
      - Example: I do a config project and you wish to add things to it in future but dont want to pay for the license waiver. I can provide a non-obfucated cpp which has all the elements ready for you to add/edit what you want (It just won't contain the work I have done (I.e Classnames and Inheritance will be there)).
      - Example: I create textures for you, and I could provide a setup template which allows you to add your own textures using my template file. 

- Any and All work which is proposed **MUST** follow Bohemia's EULA. (I'm not selling Arma-ready assets)

- Acknowledge that the work I do, shall not be used in mods which are considered grey areas. 
   - If you need to question if your mod is considered to be in a grey area, i.e not strictly following the EULA, then my work is not to be used for it. 

- Acknowledge I accept no responsibility for mods that receive DMCA's and/or Removal from the Steam Workshop.
   - Any work I complete shall be done so, following the licenses of other creaters involved (Either directly or indirectly). 
      - Example: If you need a compat mod for RHS then I shall follow RHS's license, should the mod you make (which includes my files) recieve a DMCA from RHS (In this examples case), I shall not be held responsible (in-part or wholey) for the infractions caused, **UNLESS** the infractions are **DIRECTLY** to-do with my files. 

## How I work

As a freelancer, I work how and when I want to, the only time I work to a deadline is when you are paying me to do so. <br>

I have the right to live a life outside of any work I undertake. <br>

I work on a per hour rate (see [How Much I Charge](https://github.com/Eagle-Studios/CE_Mods/blob/main/FreelanceInfo.md#how-much-i-charge)), which is worked out only on the time spent completing the work required, I do this to ensure that you (the purchaser) are not in a position to tell me when I can or cannot be working. <br>

I can provide an itemised breakdown of the price I quote, should you wish. <br>

I may not be able to complete all the work you have asked, should this be the case I shall discuss with you the options I can offer (I.e. The retexturing that you have ordered requires extra work that is beyond my ability, I shall discuss options like paying someone I know to complete that part of the work as part of the payment plan you have with me (or perhaps you wish to go elsewhere to your own person for that) either way, this (or the matter in  hand) shall be discussed BEFORE I commit to doing anything further). <br>

I work under the idea that by providing an affordable & transparent service, that you may come back to me with further work, or perhaps direct someone else my way. <br>

I am able and more than willing to provide updates to any work that you have tasked me to complete, I do this in order to give peace of mind that I am actually working on your work. <br>

I may be able to offer milestone based payments which turn any work into modules which you can pay for separately. <br>
   - This works by seperating your project into segments which can be paid individually, you can chose to have these files as seperate files or wait to be combined into the main project files. 
      - Splitting the files up, does not mean you can gain access to a unbinned file, and then go about reverse engineering (or copying etc) my work and do the rest yourself, if thats what your plan is then you would be violating my license.
      - You will still only get the files at the end, but it means you dont have to pay for an entire project in one go.


## How Much I Charge
For general config work I work at a rate of £40 per-hour, _as mentioned above_ this is calculated on how much time I have spent working specifically on your project or if paying using the _described above_ milestone system, it will be worked as per the agreed module. <br>

Should you wish to edit, modify, build upon the work provided, I charge an additional £80 to waive the [supplied license](LicenseFreelance.md). <br>
 - This is per project. 

Note that additional charges may occur should I need to spend time looking into/researching a topic that your project involves; this will be communicated with you at the time. <br>

Scripting, 3D moddelling are servies that I cannot provide personally (I do have contacts that can do these).
